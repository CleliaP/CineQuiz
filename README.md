This app uses [The Movie Database (TMDb) API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3) to gather movie and actor and then dynamically creates a unique set of questions each round.

## Explanation

* Redux 

I knew the principle of redux with my old company but I hadn't really used it. I understood it better in the middle of the project and used it then. If I had understood it better, I would have used it at the beginning of the project. Now I would use it better for future projects.

* CHANGELOG file

The file allows you to list all the changes that have been made during development. It is used in particular during a delivery to have the information more easily in the project. It avoids searching in the git project through commits.
